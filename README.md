//*Information architecture*//

The information on my CV website is organized in a simple and easy way to navigate.
The main sections are laid out in a clear order, with the most important info right at the top. 
First, there’s the navigation bar, which lets you quickly jump to any part of the page. 
It’s centered for a clean look, and at the very start, there’s an image with my name, adding a personal touch right away.

Right under the navigation bar, there’s a brief section where I introduce myself and give you ways to contact me,
including links to my social media, so you can easily get in touch.

Next is the “About Me” section, where I go into more detail about my background,
 what I’m studying, and some personal info like my phone number and city, so you can get to know me better.

Then comes the “Skills” section, where I talk about my programming knowledge and other personal skills I’ve developed.
After that, I dive into my education and experience, sharing details about my high school, special courses I’ve taken,
and my current studies at university.

Following that, I list the languages I speak, since it’s important to know how multilingual I am.
 Finally, there’s a “Projects” section where I showcase the work I’ve done, and if you want more info,
 there’s a link to a PDF with extra details. 
 Each section is designed to flow naturally, making it easy for you to navigate through my profile.
 
//*Visual design*//

At the beginning of this project, I faced some challenges because my initial Figma design didn’t fully convince me.
I created several versions before arriving at the final one. In this version,
I followed the typical structure of modern websites, placing the navigation bar at the top with the logo on the left and the website sections centered.

The Home section is designed to be visually attractive, with different text sizes and colors. It includes three social media icons,
which I customized using Boxicons, and changed their colors to match the color palette of the website.
I also added an image of myself next to the text.

Below the Home section, the About Me section follows the same visual style.
 I placed an image on the opposite side of where the Home image was, and aligned it with the text.
 To make the section more visually appealing, I added a button that allows users to download my CV.

In the Skills section, I used the website’s main colors:
 blue to represent my knowledge and gray for areas I still need to improve.
 Instead of using lines to represent personal skills, I opted for circles.

The Education/Experience section is simpler visually but contains important information.
I organized it with six rectangles; originally, there were only five, 
but I added the physics and mathematics courses to make it more uniform.

The Languages section follows a similar structure as the Experience section, but horizontally.
 I included icons representing each country and added a brief explanation of my proficiency in each language.

Finally, I designed the Projects section with three rectangles.
Since the number was odd, I placed the third project in the center and the other two below.
Initially, I didn’t use hover effects, but later I added a transition where a gradient appears from the bottom with project
details and a link to a PDF for more information.
